## Load Balancer Concepts and Differences between L4 and L7 Load Balancers

### Introduction

Load balancers are critical components in distributed computing environments. They ensure efficient distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers, optimizing resource use, improving response times, and enhancing availability. This documentation covers the key concepts of load balancing and delves into the differences between Layer 4 (L4) Network Load Balancers and Layer 7 (L7) Application Load Balancers.

### Load Balancer Concepts

#### Key Functions of Load Balancers

1.  Traffic Distribution: Evenly distributing incoming requests across a pool of servers.

2.  High Availability: Ensuring that applications remain available even if one or more servers fail.

3.  Scalability: Allowing easy addition of new servers to handle increased load.

4.  Health Monitoring: Continuously checking the health of servers and rerouting traffic away from unhealthy ones. 5. Security: Protecting applications from certain types of attacks by managing traffic flow.

Types of Load Balancers

1. Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices dedicated to load balancing.

2. Software Load Balancers: Applications or services running on standard hardware.

3. Cloud Load Balancers: Services provided by cloud providers to distribute traffic among cloud-based resources.
