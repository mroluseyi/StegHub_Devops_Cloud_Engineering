# Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD)

## Overview

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are three key practices in modern software development aimed at increasing the efficiency and reliability of software releases. These practices are closely related and often implemented together in a DevOps pipeline, but they serve different purposes and have distinct processes.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, usually several times a day. Each merge is automatically built and tested to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It ensures that the software can be reliably released at any time.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of Continuous Delivery where every change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production without manual intervention.
